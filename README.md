# ToDoList_Demo.2
A simple To Do List, created for my convenience.

---

This is a better To Do List compared to the original 'ToDoList_Demo.1'

Differences:
- Much Better UI and Mobile-Friendly.
- Save progress/data on the cloud via firestore (Sign-in required/forced)
- A few extra features such as:
- 1) CommonMark Markdown is now implemented when writing task descriptions
- 2) Datepickr is used when picking a date for each task
- 3) The ability to create multiple tasks for a card in one go


Note: Data is stored on firebase -> 'firestore database'.

Note: User accounts are secured via firebase authentication. And No, I do not have access/unable to view any passwords you put in when registering.
