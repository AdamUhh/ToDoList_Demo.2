# ToDoList_Demo.2
A simple To Do List, created for my convenience.

---

This is a better To Do List compared to the original 'ToDoList_Demo.1'

Differences:
- Much Better UI and Mobile-Friendly.
- Save progress/data on the cloud via firestore (Sign-in required/forced)
- Extra features such as:
- 1) CommonMark Markdown is now implemented when writing task descriptions
- 2) The ability to create multiple tasks for a card in one go
